      "full": "Black-Eyed Children (BEK) are a modern paranormal phenomenon describing encounters with children or teenagers possessing completely black eyes—no visible whites, irises, or pupils. These entities typically appear at doorsteps or near parked vehicles, politely but insistently requesting entry or assistance. Witnesses consistently report feeling overwhelming dread, a primal sense of danger, and the conviction that allowing entry would be disastrous. First widely documented in journalist Brian Bethel's 1996 account from Abilene, Texas, reports have proliferated via internet forums and creepypasta communities. The phenomenon represents a unique intersection of modern urban legend, potential paranormal entity reports, and internet folklore evolution."
