## Research Gaps & Needed Sources

### What's Missing

- **Pre-1996 accounts**: None documented (if you know of any, please report)
- **Verified photographs/video**: None exist
- **Independent academic study**: No peer-reviewed research specifically on BEK
- **Sleep study correlation**: No research linking BEK reports to sleep disorders
- **Comparative cultural analysis**: Limited cross-cultural examination
- **Linguistic analysis**: No study of speech patterns reported by witnesses
- **Geographic analysis**: No systematic mapping of all reports

### Areas for Further Research

1. Comprehensive database of all reported encounters
2. Temporal analysis of report frequency vs. media coverage
3. Psychological study of witnesses
4. Folklore comparison across cultures
5. Linguistic analysis of reported entity speech
6. Sleep disorder correlation study
7. Contact lens prank documentation

## Disclaimer

This bibliography includes sources representing multiple perspectives: believers in paranormal explanations, skeptics, folklore scholars, and witnesses. Inclusion does not indicate endorsement of conclusions.

Many BEK accounts originate from internet forums where fiction and non-fiction mix freely. Researchers should approach with appropriate critical thinking while remaining open to witness experiences.
